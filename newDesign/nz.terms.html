                                <li>By agreeing to enter this Deferred Payments Contract<br />
                                    in respect of any purchase (the “Contract”), you agree to pay Openpay Pty Ltd Pty Ltd ACN 159 699 126 of 40/120 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia (“we”, “us”, “Openpay”) the instalments specified in the Openpay Deferred Payment Plan (the ” Plan”) contained in the store receipt that is issued to you in respect of that purchase.</li>
                                <li>You agree to pay such instalments in consideration for Openpay paying the retailer the balance of the price for goods purchased by you from the retailer, and you agree to do so on these terms and conditions.</li>
                                <li>You will be taken to have agreed to these terms and conditions and to the accompanying privacy terms contained in the section headed <em>‘Collection and use of your personal information’</em>of this brochure by signing an electronic signature pad for the relevant Plan.</li>

                                <li>You acknowledge that Openpay may decline to enter this Contract with you in our absolute discretion.</li>
                                <li>You must retain this Contract and your Plan as they represent your contract with Openpay.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Your payment obligation</strong></li>
                        <li>This Contract is free from interest and free from upfront or monthly fees.</li>
                        <li>You must pay a 20% deposit on your nominated MasterCard or Visa debit or credit card (“Nominated Card”) in store before you take your purchases home. If the purchase price of your goods exceeds the aggregate purchase amount threshold imposed by Openpay (details of which can be found on our website – myopenpay.co.nz) (the “Openpay Transaction Limit”), you must pay a 20% deposit on the Openpay Transaction Limit plus the additional amount that exceeds the Openpay Transaction Limit.</li>

                                <li>Instalments may be paid by cheque or money order sent by post to GPO BOX 5262, Melbourne VIC 3001, Australia.

                                <li>Requested changes to payment schedules in your Plan may incur a Plan administration fee of $5 per variation and must be paid by you at the time of requesting the variation.</li>

                                <li>If you fail to make a payment by its due date, a late payment fee of $7.50 applies and must be paid by you immediately. You authorise us to recover this fee by a charge to your Nominated Card.</li>
