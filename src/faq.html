                While we take payment on the date you choose, some banks can
                take 3-5 business days to process your funds. Your statement
                will reflect the date the funds clear, and in the interim your
                transaction could be shown as ‘pending’. If you’re unsure if
                your payment has cleared, check with your bank.
