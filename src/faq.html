                        While we take payment on the date you choose, some banks can take 3-5 business days to process
                        your funds. Your statement will reflect the date the funds clear, and in the interim your
                        transaction could be shown as ‘pending’. If you’re unsure if your payment has cleared, check
                        with your bank.
